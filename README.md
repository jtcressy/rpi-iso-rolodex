# ISO Rolodex for Raspberry Pi Zero
### Uses g_multi (g_ether + g_mass_storage) to expose bootable ISO's over usb OTG in tandem with usb ethernet (in dhcp client mode) with a web interface to upload/download and select ISO files to use. 

At time of writing, project is extremely early stage WIP. Web interface has not even begun being written. Full guide and code will be available gradually as I complete them. Prototype software configurations are working so far.
